## Course Overview

In this class, we are exploring the fascinating world of machine learning, covering topics such as:

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Deep Learning
- and much more!

## Assignments

You can find the assignments for this course in the [Homework](/Homework) directory of this repository. Each assignment comes with its own README explaining the task and submission details.

## Paper Reviews

As part of our course, I have been reading and summarizing research papers in the field of machine learning. Below, you can find tables summarizing the papers I have read:
### Paper 1: A Transformer-based Framework for Multivariate Time Series Representation Learning (KDD 2021)
| Problem          | Key Related Work | Research Gap | Solution | Results |

## Planned Group Project

As part of this course, we have a group project planned for the future. We will be working on an exciting machine learning project, and more details will be provided as the project progresses.

Stay tuned for updates on the group project!



## Getting Started

To get started with the materials in this repository, you'll need the following:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Docker (Optional)**: If you want to set up a Docker environment for running your machine learning projects, follow these steps:

   - **Step 1**: Download and install Docker from the official website: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

   - **Step 2**: Verify your Docker installation by running the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```

   - **Step 3**: You can now use Docker to create and manage containers for your machine learning projects.

3. **Clone the Repository**: You can clone this repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nutdanai1221/ML.git

4. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
